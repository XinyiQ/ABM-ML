This is for Machine learning.
This package contains the python scripts of machine learning, input data which was acquired from ABM model, and the final output of precdiction by Random forest regression.

The tick2014_new.csv and tick_2010_new.csv is the output from ABM model. They were preprocessed before using in Machine learning and Exploratory Data Analysis.
EDA_2010.ipynb and EDA_2014.ipynb are the scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis.
Feature importance-2010.ipynb is the scripts to calcaulate the feature importance of each parameter which result to tick bite.
Prediction based on 2010 & 2014.ipynb is the scripts for prediction by using Random forset regression.
The new.csv is the final output by prediction.
